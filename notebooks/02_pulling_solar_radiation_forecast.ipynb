    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project focuses on analyzing historical solar irradiance and other features to train a model. With this model using weather forecasts one should be able to predict solar energy generation.\n",
    "This data is retrieved from (https://open-meteo.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Source\n",
    "The dataset is fetched using the open-meteo API and includes key parameters such as:\n",
    "- **Shortwave radiation**: Measured in W\\m2\n",
    "- **Air temperature (T2m)**: Measured in °C\n",
    "- **Wind speed (WS10m)**: Measured in m/s at 10m\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Location**: Latitude and Longitude chosen for Freiburg im Breisgau\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Goal\n",
    "The objective is to preprocess, analyze, and build models that can predict solar energy generation for Baden-Württemberg based on weather forecasts.\n"
